This is a project i have been doing on the way along i learn new skills on full stack web development from udemy.
I have used HTML and CSS in the start of the project and got in=troduced to bootstrap.
It was a real game-changer for me, as things like button, navbar turned out pretty easy by learning that.
Also the use of container fluid  and grid system really made by website slick when resizing and responsive to all screensizes.
Use of carousel and cards did add a bit of icing on the cake.
